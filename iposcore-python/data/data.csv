À admissão apresentava ascite pelo que foi orientada para a Radiologia de Intervenção para colocação de dreno abdominal. 
Durante o internamento manteve quadro de oclusao intestinal sem transito para fezes ou gases, pelo que foi realizado estudo complementar que revelou carcinomatose peritoneal com múltiplos implantes peritoneais (um deles irressecavel), metastização hepática, multiplas adenopatias no andar superior do abdomen e raiz mesentérica e marcada dilatação luminal com niveis hidroaereos das ansas do delgado. Foi observado pela cirurgia que reforçou ausência de benefício de intervenção cirurgica e discutido o caso em reuniao de grupo de Ginecologia decidindo-se por medidas paliativas com colaboração do SCP. De referir ainda a decisão de suspensão de hipocoagulação pela aslterações da coagulação condicionadas pela evolução da doença.
A doente evolui com deterioração do quadro clínico e do estado de consciencia com dispneia intensa e dessaturação, dor abdominal.","hospitalization at the beginning of outrubro by subocclusive condition that was resolved with conservative treatment but was readmitted on October 15 for the same reason. At admission she presented ascites, which was oriented to Intervention Radiology for abdominal drain placement. 
During hospitalization, he maintained intestinal occlusion without transit for feces or gases, so a complementary study was conducted that revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis with multiple peritoneal implants (one of them unresectable), hepatic metastatics, multiple adenopathies in the upper abdomen and mesenteric root and marked luminal dilation with hydroaereous levels of the slender ansae. It was observed by the surgery that reinforced the absence of benefit of surgical intervention and discussed the case in a gynecology group meeting, deciding on palliative measures with the collaboration of the PCS. It should also be noted the decision to suspend hypocoagulation due to coagulation aslters conditioned by the evolution of the disease.
The patient progresses with deterioration of the clinical picture and the state of consciousness with severe dyspnea and desaturation, abdominal pain.

Após indução foi administrado plasma e foi colocado cvc de curta duração na JIDta picada única sem intercorrências. Colocadas placas multifunções e magneto antes do início da cirurgia.
Perfil hemodinamico com hipotensão grave sem resposta ao volume e efedrina. Foi iniciado noradrenalina. Verificado periodos de taquicardia ventricular autolimitados, realizado bólus de amiodarona e por não estar a ser utilizado bisturi optou-se por retirar o magneto.
Corrigida hipocaliemia com 2 amp KCl. Administrado 50ml de albumina a 20,1000ml de cristalóides, 3 U PFC e 1 U CE.
Anúrica.
Perdas hemáticas estimadas em 700ml.
Analgesia com sufentanil em perfusão.
No final da cirurgia a doente foi discutida novamente com a equipa cirurgica e SCI e mantem-se a não indicação de suporte de disfunção de orgão.

After induction, plasma was administered and short-term cvc was placed in the single chopped IADB without complications. Multifunction plates and magneto are placed before the start of surgery.
Hemodynamic profile with severe hypotension unresponsive to volume and ephedrine. Norepinephrine was initiated. Since periods of self-limited ventricular tachycardia were verified, performed amiodarone bolus and because scalpel was not being used, it was decided to remove the magnet.
Corrected hypokalaemia with 2 amp KCl. Administered 50ml albumin at 20,1000ml crystalloids, 3 U PFC and 1 U CE.
Anuric.
Hematic losses estimated at 700ml.
Analgesia with sufentanil in infusion.
At the end of the surgery, the patient was discussed again with the surgical team and SCI and there is no indication of organ dysfunction support.
A patient who was neglected at the end, with respiratory drive, is transported to ICU-B on spontaneous ventilation by TOT and aminergic support will be suspended.death in icu-patient in septic shock by peritonitis and with severe cardic parology.",IRC estadio 4+DM2+Portadora de CDI por insuficiênciaiciência cardíaca etiologia isquémica+EAM,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
